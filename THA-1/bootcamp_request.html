    <p>Respected sir,</p>
    <p>I am a student of your college in the branch of Information Science and Engineering.
       I represent a student group called Devsnest where we are planning for a 30 day online bootcamp for all students in our college.</p>
    <p>This is a special bootcamp where all the participants will be split up into teams.
        Afterwards everyone will be taught the basics of programming in Python and given daily THA's(Take-Home assignments) for the groups to collaborate and solve together.
        This will also include weekly mentorship sessions from our alumni from big tech companies like FAANG to provide mentorship to our participants.
        Towards the end, all the participants will receive a participation certificate and the top three performing teams will be rewarded and be given a letter of recommendation from our alumni for enhanced job prospects.
        <br>
        The participants will learn:
        <ul>
            <li>Basics of Python</li>
            <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
            <li>Problem solving in Python</li>
        </ul></p>
    <p>We request you to provide us the opportunity of providing an informative bootcamp for our college to increase awareness among our students about the IT sector.
        We would be grateful if you allow us to conduct this bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>Thanking You</p>
    <p>Your's Sincerely</p>
    <p>PGP</p>
